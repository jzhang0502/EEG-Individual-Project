## About The Project ðŸ§ :
This project aims to create an Electroencephalogram (EEG) system that records and utilises the user's neuroactivities, enabling the user to remotely activate a coffee machine with only the thoughts of wanting more coffee. It is advised, however, to consume caffeine in a responsible and moderate quantity.

## Milestones:
- [ ] Complete building functional EEG device
    - [x] Research on fundamental mechanisms of an EEG headset
    - [x] Identify and sketch out primary circuit elements
    - [x] Create schematic of EEG device on LTspice
    - [x] Source all required circuit components on DigiKey
    - [x] Complete project symbol library and overall schematic on KiCad
    - [ ] Complete PCB design on KiCad
    - [ ] Finish assembling all components on custom PCB and test out EEG device
- [ ] Perform signal processing and analysis on EEG data
- [ ] Create models capable of recognising specific EEG activities
